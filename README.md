# Automated Cypress Tests on OL map

This repository is a minimal demonstration on how to test an OL map, and how to use cypress tests as a kind of implementation "checklist" for map functionalities.

The map functionalities are implemented in [/main.js](./main.js), and the tests are defined in [/cypress/e2e/](./cypress/e2e/).

To try it, simply run

```
npm install
npm run cypress (interactive mode)
npm run test (cli mode)
```
